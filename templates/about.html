                                This prediction model was made using a data set found on kaggle.com, originally from a Analytics Vidhya Hackathon on Healthcare Analytics. 
                            After cleaning the data in Google Colaboratory, building the neural network model with Tensorflow, and fitting the model with the data, 
                            we were able to predict the length of a hospital stay with about 42% accuracy. Though this seems like a poor score at first, no other properly completed coding submissions viewed
                            on Kaggle had scores that beat this value. This likely means that 42% could be the ceiling for accuracy in this case, given the unpredictability of healthcare. The main limitations were the size of the data set as well as
                            little to no documentation on the meanings of the columns/values. Nevertheless, if a user hypothetically had access to all of the information required,
                            they could use this model to make a prediction. This could be useful for a patient's own knowledge and efficiency in selecting a hospital, or
                            for hospital staff to keep track of and make decisions for their patients.
